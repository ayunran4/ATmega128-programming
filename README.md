# AVR
This repository is about study of Atmega128 programming.  
I code these on CodeVision. So if you run these, you may have to edit them little bit.

## Variable resistance
Program with variable-resistance.  
The analog value is changed by turnning switch. Received it and then show it by a 7-segment.

RTC stands for real time clock. We use it to count time.
